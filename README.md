Porcelain insulators are critical components of power systems, and their continuous exposure to environmental, mechanical, and electrical stresses often leads to defects that can compromise system reliability. Conventional methods are time-consuming, workman-dependent, and unsuitable for large-scale networks, necessitating automated image-based fault identification frameworks. Although numerous machine learning and deep learning models have been explored for insulator fault identifi
cation, reliance on a single model frequently results in suboptimal performance. This motivates the adoption of ensemble techniques that combine predictions from multiple models to improve robust ness and accuracy. Furthermore, identification performance is strongly influenced by image type and quality, as well as the selection of activation functions and hyperparameter optimisers. In this context, this paper proposes a majority-voting-based ensemble framework for accurate insulator fault iden
tification using both terrestrial and UAV-acquired images. Multiple models, including MLP, KNN, CNN, EfficientNet-B0, CoAtNet-0, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, are implemented and evaluated; however, only models achieving an accuracy of at least 90% are considered for ensemble construction, with MLP and KNN excluded due to inferior performance. The majority voting ensembling strategy requires an odd number of constituent models to prevent tie situations; therefore, the most effective three-model combination from the eligible models is selected for the ensemble. In addition, the framework integrates Contrast Adjustment Enhancement (CAE) with Wiener filtering to enhance defect contrast while suppressing noise, and investigates suitable activation functions, optimization techniques, and image formats. Experimental results on a publicly available insulator dataset demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a maximum classification accuracy of 98.76%.
